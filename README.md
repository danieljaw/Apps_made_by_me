# Apps made by me
here I will share all the applications I have created


# General info
Feel free to browse through the applications - here I will share all the applications I have created.


### Short comment about the visibility of apps.
Of course, the folder will be updated as and when possible. Some applications I make available in a private repository.
I try to make sure that I also show sample ideas here to help me become a better programmer.


### Updating
Intentionally, I know I will want to update long-published apps. Each one will show the learning process.







# First uploaded app (v.2.03)
## PasswordGenerator

The application is designed to develop the ability to use both the basics and extended topics related to syntaxes, loops and more. 
The highlights of this project (v 2.03) are: 

1. setting up more than five screens (ViewController).
2. connecting them using Segue.
3. Setting the necessary distances between buttons.
4. Writing the code that will generate the password. All coupled to the selectable buttons. 
4.1* The same code is available from me in JAVA/Kotlin - in the Java/Kotlin repository


5. More comming soon :)
